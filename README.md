## ⚡ Performance Optimizations (Hackathon Enhancements)

### 🔐 Authentication Optimization
- Reduced bcrypt hashing rounds for demo responsiveness
- Login time reduced from ~15s to ~2–3s
- JWT-based secure session management

### 🚀 Database Improvements
- Parallel `.populate()` queries
- `.lean()` queries for read-only endpoints
- Reduced response latency by 20–30%

### 🔄 Prefetching System
- Post-login background data prefetch
- Dashboard renders instantly
- Parallel API fetching using `Promise.allSettled()`

### 📊 Government Analytics Caching
- COVID data cached in localStorage (6-hour expiry)
- Eliminates repeated external API delay
- Corruption-safe cache handling with try/catch

### 🛡 Stability Hardening
- Defensive JSON parsing
- localStorage quota protection
- Script race-condition prevention
- Partial API failure tolerance

## 🔄 Prefetch Strategy

After successful login:

1. Appointments
2. Hospitals
3. Profile data

are fetched in parallel and cached for instant dashboard rendering.

This significantly improves perceived performance and user experience.

---

## 🧪 Demo Flow

1. Login as Patient
2. Observe login speed (<3 seconds)
3. Navigate to Dashboard (instant render via prefetch)
4. Switch to Government role
5. Open analytics dashboard
6. Refresh page (cached data loads instantly)

---

## 🧠 Key Engineering Decisions

- Prioritized perceived performance over heavy architectural refactors
- Implemented safe caching with corruption handling
- Used defensive programming for stability under edge cases
- Maintained clean branch-based Git workflow for safe deployment
