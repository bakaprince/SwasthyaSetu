# How to Access Government Portal Pages

## ✅ FIXED - Navigation Now Working!

The "This feature is currently under development" error has been resolved. All navigation links now point to the actual pages.

## 📍 Access Points

### Option 1: Direct URL Access
You can access any government page directly by navigating to:

1. **Government Dashboard (Main)**
   ```
   pages/government-dashboard.html
   ```

2. **Hospital Connectivity**
   ```
   pages/government-hospitals.html
   ```

3. **Data Exchange Logs**
   ```
   pages/government-logs.html
   ```

4. **Compliance Monitor**
   ```
   pages/government-compliance.html
   ```

### Option 2: Through Navigation
Once you're on any government portal page, use the top navigation bar to switch between pages:
- Click "National Dashboard" → Main overview
- Click "Hospital Connectivity" → Hospital status monitoring
- Click "Data Exchange Logs" → Transaction logs
- Click "Compliance Monitor" → Compliance tracking

## 🔐 Authentication Required

All government portal pages require authentication. Make sure you're logged in with:
- **User Type:** Government or Admin
- **Valid Session:** Active login session

If you're not logged in, you'll be redirected to the main page.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Login to the system** (if not already logged in)
2. **Navigate to:** `pages/government-dashboard.html`
3. **Use the navigation bar** to access other pages

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

**Before:**
- Navigation links pointed to `#` (placeholder)
- Clicking them triggered "under development" message
- Pages existed but weren't accessible

**After:**
- All links updated to point to actual pages:
  - `government-dashboard.html`
  - `government-hospitals.html`
  - `government-logs.html`
  - `government-compliance.html`
- Full navigation between all pages working
- No more "under development" errors

## 📝 Notes

- The "under development" message appears only for features that genuinely don't exist yet
- All 4 government portal pages are now fully functional
- Navigation is consistent across all pages
- Each page has proper authentication checks

## 🎯 Testing

To verify everything works:
1. Open `pages/government-dashboard.html` in your browser
2. Click on "Hospital Connectivity" in the navigation
3. You should see the hospital connectivity page load
4. Try navigating to other pages using the nav bar
5. All pages should load without errors

**Status:** ✅ All government portal pages are now accessible and fully functional!
